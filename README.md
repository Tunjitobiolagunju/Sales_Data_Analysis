# Sales_Data_Analysis

## Overview:
This report provides an analysis of sales data for the period between  January 2021 and March 2023, focusing on how products in each category are performing in different shopping malls. The report includes information on total number of sales, total quantity sold, total revenue, top selling products category, least selling products category, top revenue generating product, top-selling store, least selling store, and top payment method. Based on the analysis of this data, I have identified several key insights and recommendations for improving sales performance.

## Key Insights:

Total number of sales: 99,457
Total quantity sold: 298,712
Total revenue: $68.55M
Top selling products category: Clothing (103,558)
Least selling products category: Souvenir (14,871)
Top revenue generating product: Clothing ($31M)
Top selling store: Mall of Istanbul ($14M)
Least selling store: Forum Istanbul($3M)
Top payment method: Cash

## Recommendations:

1. Increase focus on top-selling products: Given that clothing is the top-selling product category and generates the most revenue with the female clothing performing more, I recommend increasing focus on promoting clothing. This could include targeted advertising campaigns, sales promotions, or offering discounts on related products.

2.Evaluate and improve sales of low-performing products: As the Souvenir category is the least selling, I recommend evaluating the marketing strategy, pricing strategy, or product design to improve sales. This could involve increasing marketing efforts or improving the design of products in the category to make them more appealing to customers.

3. Increase sales performance in low-performing stores: As Forum istan is the least selling store, I recommend analyzing the marketing strategy and pricing strategy to improve sales performance. This could involve introducing new products, redesigning the store layout, or retraining staff to improve their sales skills.

4. Diversify payment methods: While cash is the top payment method, I recommend diversifying payment methods to include digital payment options, such as mobile payments and online payments. This could provide more convenience for customers and improve sales performance.
